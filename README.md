# Advent of Code 2021

I wanted to learn both Go and Rust this year, but never found the time beyond doing a few leetcode exercises in Go. I plan to use this event as an oppourtunity to learn how to use both, hopefully reflecting my growth in one or both languages by the end of the event.

Update (12/4): Today I only did the exercise in Rust. Overall I have been having a better experience coding in Rust, and I may continue only doing these excercises in Rust for the remainder of the event. I may revisit this project at some point during or after the event and re-complete days in Go as well, but for now Go feels very clunky for the kinds of array operations most of these puzzles require.
